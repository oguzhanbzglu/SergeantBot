# SergeantBot

* I am presenting a four-wheeled mobile robot that is based on the ROS (Robot Operating System). It uses a Raspberry Pi Model 3B+ to receive messages, commands, and signals from our personal computers. I have implemented a 2D LiDAR (YD LIDAR) for obstacle detection and other similar applications, with a capacity of 8 meters. On the other hand, I am using odometry and IMU data for the robot's positioning.

* However, I am still working on this project (SergeantBot) and will provide updates when they become available.
